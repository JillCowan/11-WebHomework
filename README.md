## Latitude - An Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework we created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment to analyze how weather varies based on proximity to the equator.
 
We used Python, Pandas, OpenWeather API, JSON, matplotlib, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create 7 individual pages and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations, along with a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and an additional page where we can view the data used to build them.
